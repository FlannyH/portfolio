<!--SUMMARY-->
<div class="content">
	<p>
		Building on what I learned when making my old OpenGL renderer, combined with what I learned at university and at my internship, I started working on a renderer using DirectX 12.
	</p>
	<p>
		Using DirectX 12 over OpenGL means I have lower level access to the GPU, and allows me to use modern features like hardware accelerated ray tracing (RTX). I chose DirectX 12 over Vulkan, because I learned more about DirectX 12 than Vulkan at this point.
	</p>
	<p>
		The aim of this project is to build a real-time renderer (60 FPS), which looks as close to the reference pathtracer as I can get. I'm currently running an RTX 3060 12 GB, but it would be very nice if the real-time renderer also runs at acceptable frame rates on low end hardware like the GTX 1050, perhaps using a lower quality setting.
	</p>
	<p>
		You can switch between the pathtracer renderer and the real-time using the number keys, where 1 is the work-in-progress real-time renderer, and 2 is the reference pathtracer.
	</p>
	<p>
		This project is currently in development. Here is where the project is at right now:
		<ul>
			<li>🔦 Physically based path tracer with temporal accumulation</li>
			<li>💡 Implements the same BRDF as common rendering engines like Unreal Engine and Blender</li>
			<li>🖼️ Supports glTF scene loading with correct transforms</li>
			<li>🎥 Fly around the scene with the debug camera</li>
			<li>🛠️ Flexible DirectX 12 render backend, with a Vulkan render backend coming soon</li>
			<li>⚡ Work in progress real-time renderer, using image-based lighting for specular lighting, and spherical harmonics for diffuse lighting</li>
			<li>🎨 ACES tonemapping</li>
		</ul>
