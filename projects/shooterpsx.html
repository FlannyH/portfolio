<!--SUMMARY-->
<div class="content">
	<p>
		I have always dreamed of creating a game for the PlayStation 1, the first game console I ever played as a child.
		So, I decided to learn how the console works, and make my own game for it.
	</p>
	<p>
		To compile the project into a disc image the PlayStation 1 can play, I used PSn00bSDK, an open source SDK featuring a C compiler for developing homebrew applications and games for the PS1. It uses CMake to build the project, which gave me a great opportunity to learn how to use CMake properly.
	</p>
	<p>
		This project is currently in development, so here is where the project is at right now:
		<ul>
			<li>🖥️Cross-platform 3D renderer between PS1, Windows and Linux.</li>
			<li>💾Model loading, texture loading, and vertex colors.</li>
			<li>💾Custom binary file formats for 3D models and texture collection, documented on the GitHub page.</li>
			<li>🎮Basic first-person player character controller</li>
			<li>📐My own collision detection code, including a BVH acceleration structure to optimize the collision detection.</li>
			<li>⏱️30+ FPS on PS1, mostly bottlenecked by the graphics pipeline.</li>
			<li>🖌️The intro to Sub Nivis's first level modeled by hand to fit the PS1 hardware.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		Optimizing performance is a big part of this project, since the Playstation 1 is relatively slow console by today's standards. Given the limited floating-point capabilities of the console, I decided to use fixed-point numbers for all my calculations.
		The video above shows how the current build runs on the console.
