<!--SUMMARY-->
<div class="content">
	<p>
		SUB NIVIS is a first-person shooter inspired by classics like Quake and DOOM. Play as Sister Maria, a nun sent to succeed where others like the Vatican and the UN failed: the Black Pyramid of Alaska.
	</p>

	<p>
		Once thought to be a figment of only the wildest conspiracies, the Black Pyramid is a terrible reality. Swarming with techno ghosts hell-bent on destruction, you were sent to send them back to their cold, metal graves. Use your trusty sword, the Archangel's Absolver, to slice-n'-dice your way through the techno-horde. Or use your revolver to blow their mechanical brains out!
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Collect several Power-Ups to make your task easier - but be aware, as with anything on God's green earth, they too are only temporary. Use the supplies left behind by a lost UN task force scattered through the Pyramid to bring an end to the scourge that threatens all of humanity.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Can you survive the dangers of the black pyramid and succeed where others failed?   
	</p>
